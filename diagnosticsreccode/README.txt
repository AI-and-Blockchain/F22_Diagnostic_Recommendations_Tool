This is the code folder for our project.

We follow a package and module structure here. 

So when running files, run it from the diagnosticsreccode directory level and run .py files within each of our sub-component directories. E.g.,
  python MachineLearning_comp/run_model.py -> will execute code in the machine learning part of the diagnosticsreccode package.
